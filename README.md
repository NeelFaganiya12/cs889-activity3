```

2. **Set up your Gemini API keys** (for AI features):
   - Create `.env` file in the project root
   - Add up to 3 API keys for load balancing:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY_1=your_first_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY_2=your_second_api_key_here
     GEMINI_API_KEY_3=your_third_api_key_here

   - The app will automatically rotate between available keys

3. **Prepare local papers** (optional):
   - Create `papers.json` file with your papers in the following format:
     ```json
     {
       "references": [
         {
           "id": 1,
           "title": "Paper Title",
           "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2"],

- Uses your research topic as context

## API Keys

### Gemini API (Required for AI Features)
- **Storage**: Store in `.env` file (recommended)
- **Multiple Keys**: Supports up to 3 keys for load balancing
- **Get API Key**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- **Used for**: 
  - Paper clustering
  - Relevance ranking
  - Relevance explanations
- **Optional**: App works without it, but AI features won't be available

## Example Workflow

1. **Choose Data Source**: Select "Search Online" or "Local Papers"
2. **Search**: Enter your research topic
3. **Browse Results**: 
   - View clusters (Local Papers) or ranked queue (both modes)
   - Click "View" to see paper details
4. **Get AI Insights**:
   - See papers ranked by relevance
   - Click "Explain Relevance" for AI explanations
5. **Organize**:
   - Add papers to reading list
   - Mark papers as relevant/not relevant
   - Add notes to papers
6. **Review**:
   - Check your reading list at the bottom
   - View feedback summary (relevant/not relevant papers)

## Troubleshooting

### Search Online Issues
- **No results**: Try a different search query or check your internet connection
- **Error messages**: Check the error message for specific issues (invalid query, network errors)
- **Slow loading**: AI processing takes 10-15 seconds - this is normal

### Local Papers Issues
- **File not found**: Ensure `papers.json` exists in the project directory
- **Invalid JSON**: Check that your JSON file is properly formatted
- **No papers shown**: Verify your JSON has a "references" array with paper objects

### AI Features Issues
- **Clustering not working**: Ensure Gemini API keys are set in `.env`
- **API key errors**: 
  - Verify keys are correct in `.env`
  - Check API key quota/limits
  - Try using multiple keys for load balancing
- **"Explain Relevance" not working**: Check that you have at least one valid Gemini API key

### View Button Issues
- **Paper details not showing**: 
  - Try refreshing the page
  - Ensure you're viewing papers from the current data source
  - Switch data sources and try again

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple API Keys**: Set up 3 Gemini API keys in `.env` for better reliability
2. **Cache Results**: Recent searches are cached - use them to avoid re-searching
3. **Filter Local Papers**: Use the filter box to quickly find papers in your local collection
4. **Feedback Organization**: Mark papers as relevant/not relevant to build your feedback summary
5. **Reading List**: Add papers you want to review later to your reading list
6. **AI Explanations**: Use "Explain Relevance" to understand why papers are relevant to your research
